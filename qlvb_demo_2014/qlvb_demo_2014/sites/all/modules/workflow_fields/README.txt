Name:
Workflow Fields Module

DESCRIPTION:

The workflow_fields module extends John VanDyk's workflow module by
allowing node fields to be made invisible or read-only depending on 
the current workflow state. The workflow state form is extended to 
show all node fields with appropriate controls to hide and/or disable
each field for that particular state.

This functionality is useful when a workflow moves among users who 
have different permissions regarding the document flowing through them. 
Which is the case in most every workflow we're encountered.
