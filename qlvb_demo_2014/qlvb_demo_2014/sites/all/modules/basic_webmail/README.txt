WARNING
-------
This module is still very new and will most likely have bugs and might even
delete your e-mail when you don't want it deleted. Make sure you test it on a
test system and make sure you have valid & tested backups before putting it
onto a production server.


ABOUT
-----
The Basic webmail module allows one to read and write e-mail through an IMAP
mail server. There are not a lot of fancy features (thus the name), just a
usable webmail client.
